The CIA Triad is a foundational model in cybersecurity that defines three key principles: 
-Confidentiality 
-Integrity
-Availability


1. Confidentiality: ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals. 
It protects data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or exposure.

Example--> Online banking: When you log in to your bank account, 
your username and password ensure that only you can access your balance and transactions. 
Encryption also protects your data from being intercepted during transmission.



2. Integrity: means that data must remain accurate, complete, 
and unaltered unless changed by authorized users. 
It ensures that information is trustworthy and free from unauthorized modifications.

Example--> E-commerce transactions: When you order an item online, 
the system must ensure that the product details, quantity, and payment amount are not changed maliciously during the process. 
A checksum or digital signature helps guarantee this.



3. Availability: ensures that information and systems are accessible to authorized users whenever they need them. 
It involves maintaining uptime and resilience against disruptions.

Example--> Hospital systems: A patientâ€™s medical records must be available to doctors and nurses at all times. 
If the system is down during an emergency, it can delay critical treatment. 
Backup systems and disaster recovery plans help maintain availability.
