Digital Signatures


-->Definition:
A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that uses a private–public key pair to provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital data. 
It ensures that the message or document was created by the claimed sender (authentication), 
has not been altered during transmission (integrity), 
and that the sender cannot later deny having signed it (non-repudiation).

Integrity → The data has not been altered since it was signed.
Authentication → The message truly comes from the claimed sender (identity verification).



-->How Digital Signatures Work

>>Key Pair Generation:
-A private key (kept secret by the sender).
-A public key (shared with everyone).
>>Signing Process:
-Sender generates a hash of the message (using SHA-256 or another algorithm).
-The hash is then encrypted with the sender’s private key → this becomes the digital signature.
>>Verification Process:
-The receiver decrypts the signature using the sender’s public key to retrieve the original hash.
-The receiver also computes the hash of the received message.
-If both hashes match → the signature is valid, confirming authenticity and integrity.


-->Real-World Applications
-Secure Emails (e.g., PGP, S/MIME).
-Software Distribution (e.g., verifying installers are from the original developer).
-Legal and Financial Documents (e-signatures).
-Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies (transactions are signed with private keys).
