Asymmetric Encryption

-->Definition:
While symmetric encryption relies on a single shared secret key, 
asymmetric encryption (also called public-key cryptography) uses a pair of keys:
>>Public Key → used for encryption.
-Sender encrypts the message using the receiver’s public key.
-Only the corresponding private key can decrypt it.
>>Private Key → used for decryption.
-Receiver uses their private key to decrypt the message.
-Since only the receiver holds the private key, confidentiality is ensured.


-->Algorithms:
>>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman): 
-The most widely used algorithm for encryption, digital signatures, and secure key exchange.

>>ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): 
-Provides similar security to RSA with smaller key sizes, making it more efficient.

>>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): 
-Used primarily for digital signatures, not encryption.
