Summary


-->1. CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
-The CIA Triad forms the core principles of cybersecurity.
-Confidentiality ensures only authorized individuals access data (e.g., passwords, encryption).
-Integrity guarantees data is accurate and unchanged (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
-Availability ensures systems and data are accessible when needed (e.g., backups, redundancy).
-This model provides the framework for all security policies and controls.


-->2. Symmetric Encryption
-Uses one shared secret key for both encryption and decryption.
-Common algorithms: AES, DES, Blowfish.
-Advantage: fast and efficient.
-Limitation: key distribution problem (both parties must share the key securely).
-Python demo: encrypted and decrypted messages using the Fernet module.


-->3. Asymmetric Encryption
-Uses a public-private key pair.
-Public key encrypts data, private key decrypts it.
-Common algorithms: RSA, ECC.
-Advantage: solves the key distribution problem of symmetric encryption.
-Limitation: slower than symmetric encryption.
-Python demo: generated RSA keys, encrypted with the public key, decrypted with the private key.


-->4. Digital Signatures
-Provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.
-Created by signing a message with a private key; verified with the senderâ€™s public key.
-Ensures that the message truly came from the claimed sender and was not tampered with.
-Python demo: signed a message with a private key and verified it with the corresponding public key.


-->5. Network Security Basics
-Firewalls: filter traffic and block unauthorized access.
-VPNs: create secure tunnels over the internet to protect confidentiality.
-HTTPS: secures web communication with TLS/SSL encryption.
-Port Scanning: identifies open ports on a system (using tools like Nmap) to detect vulnerabilities.
-Basic terminal commands (ping, traceroute, nmap) were introduced as practical tools.


==>Connections Between Concepts

>Encryption (symmetric and asymmetric) protects confidentiality.

>Digital signatures protect integrity and provide authentication.

>Network security tools like firewalls, VPNs, and HTTPS enforce the CIA Triad across systems.

>Port scanning highlights the importance of monitoring for potential entry points to maintain availability and reduce risk.
